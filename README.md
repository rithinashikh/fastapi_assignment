# FastAPI CRUD Application

This is a FastAPI project implementing CRUD operations for **Items** and **User Clock-In Records**. The project is designed as part of an assignment for Vodex.ai. It performs various operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data with MongoDB. The project also includes filtering and aggregation operations for data retrieval.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**: You need Python installed on your system.
2. **MongoDB Atlas**: Create an account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or install MongoDB locally.
3. **FastAPI**: Install FastAPI and other necessary packages.
4. **Koyeb/Heroku**: Host the application on a free hosting platform.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-crud-app.git
   cd fastapi-crud-app

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up environment variables for MongoDB connection in a .env file:

    ```bash
    MONGO_URI="your-mongodb-uri"

## Database Configuration

You will need to create two collections in MongoDB for the two entities:

- items
- clock_in_records

Refer to the MongoDB Atlas documentation to set up the database and collections if you are using MongoDB Atlas.
